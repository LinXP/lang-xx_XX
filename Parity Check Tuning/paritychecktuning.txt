; page intro text
:parityProblems_intro_plug:
The **Parity Problems Assistant** is part of the **Parity Check Tuning** plugin.<p/>
The current status is **EXPERIMENTAL** and it is always possible that this assistant may be removed in the future).
**(feedback is welcomed on the basic concept and ideas for improvement)**.<p/>
The idea is that this assistant can be used after a parity check or read check has reported problems and logged the details of any problem sectors to the syslog.
In many cases such errors can be due to external factors such as cabling or the power supply rather than the actual disks.<p/>
It is also not uncommon, particularly on **Ryzen/ThreadRipper** based systems, to get random parity errors if the RAM is overclocked
(an XMP profile **is** an overclock),
and the motherboard/CPU combination may also impose limits that are lower than the RAM is capable of supporting.<p/>
If you think you have rectified whatever caused the problems to occur then you can use this assistant to run a partial check over a narrow range to see if the problem still occurs.
This can be much faster than having to run a full parity check or read check to see if you have resolved the issue or to run a disk extended SMART test to test the actual disk.<p/>
**IMPORTANT**:  This assistant should never be used as an alternative to running a full parity check once you think the problem has been resolved.

The Pause and Resume times would give an increment length of more than 12 hours which is unusual=str161|paritychecktuning
The Resume value must be greater than the Pause one for the heat related Pause and Resume to work correctly as they are both subtracted from the disk temperature warning value when calculating the desired temperature=str162|paritychecktuning

:parity_tune_automatic_plug:
> if the unRaid system is not shutdown cleanly then the next time the array is started unRaid will automatically start a non-correcting parity check (or a read check if you have no parity disk). This can happen for a wide variety of reasons ranging from power loss; hardware issues; and software issues.  The automatic check is run because if there are any parity errors this can compromise the ability to recover from an array drive failure at a later date so you want to get back to having valid parity as soon as is practical.
>
> If this option is set then the check will be allowed to run for a few minutes (as any errors after an unclean shutdown are most likely to be at the start of the disks as they were not unmounted cleanly) and then automatically put the check into a paused state (if outside the time specified for running increments) and then the  remainder of the check subsequently run in increments according to the time slots specified for running increments.

:parity_tune_clear_plug:
> Should disk Clear operations be run using increments.<br><br>A disk Clear operation occurs when you add a new drive (that has not been pre-cleared (using the Pre-Clear plugin) to an array that is parity protected.  The Clear process writes zeroes to every sector on the new disk so that it can be added to the array without affecting the existing parity. Until the Clear operation has completed you are not able to format the disk in unRaid and start using it for storing data.
>
>Since until the Clear operation completes the disk will not be available for use it is likely that most people will want this option left at **No**.   In addition, a Clear operation tends not to put much of a load on the system so is less likely to impact performance in normal daily use.

> Unraid will normally abandon a parity check if the system is shutdown, rebooted  or the array is stopped (with the only option being to restart the parity check from the beginning).

>* The array was shutdown tidily
>* The user must not have made any changes to the array configuration.
>
>As long as these criteria are met then when the array is next started the operation is resumed from the point previously reached.
>
>**NOTES:**
>* If the array operation was within the time set for a scheduled increment to be running then on restarting the array operation it will be set to be paused if now outside the time set for running increments.
>* If the array operation was manually paused then the restarted array operation will also be paused
>* If you want to use this feature by simply stopping the array without immediately using the **Reboot** or **Shutdown** buttons then you first need to manually **Pause** the array operation before using the **Stop** button.  If you to this and successfully stop the array then the array operation will now be resumed if you simply **Start** the array again, and also on the next array start after **Reboot** or **Shutdown**.
