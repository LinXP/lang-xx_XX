:diagnostics_1_plug:
This utility is used for troubleshooting purposes. It will collect all of the system information and configuration files, and package these files in a single ZIP file which can be saved locally.
Subsequently, this file can be included in your correspondence with Limetech or the Unraid forum.

This will help others to quickly get the inside information of your system and provide better support to your problem. The following information
and configuration files are collected:
:end

:diagnostics_2_plug:
+ */config*
  <br>copy all *\*.cfg files*, *go* file and the *super.dat* file. These are configuration files.
+ */config/shares*
  <br>copy all *\*.cfg* files. These are user share settings files.
+ *Syslog file(s)*
  <br>copy the current *syslog* file and any previous existing *syslog* files.
+ *System*
  <br>save output of the following commands:
  <br>lsscsi, lspci, lsusb, free, lsof, ps, ethtool & ifconfig.
  <br>display of iommu groups.
  <br>display of command line parameters (e.g. pcie acs override, pci stubbing, etc).
  <br>save system variables.
+ *SMART reports*
  <br>save a SMART report of each individual disk present in your system.
+ *Docker*
  <br>save files *docker.log*, *libvirtd.log*, *libvirt/qemu/\*.log* and *vfio-pci*.
:end

:diagnostics_3_plug:
Clicking **Download** will start the collection process and then instruct your browser to save the zip file locally.

*No personal information such as user names, passwords, or any other file contents not specified above is included
by Unraid OS; however, your server name, IP address, and user share names* **will** *be included.*

*Note that 3rd-party plugins **may** or may not store personal information in plugin-specific configuration files and/or output
to the system log.*

*Use* **Anonymize diagnostics** *when publishing the diagnostics file in the public forum. In private communication with Limetech it is recommended to uncheck this setting and capture all information unaltered.*
:end

:newconfig_plug:
This is a utility to reset the array disk configuration so that all disks appear as "New" disks, as
if it were a fresh new server.

This is useful when you have added or removed multiple drives and wish to rebuild parity based on
the new configuration.

Use the *'Preserve current assignments'* selection to populate the desired disk slots ***after*** the array has been reset. By default **no** disk slots are populated.

**DO NOT USE THIS UTILITY THINKING IT WILL REBUILD A FAILED DRIVE** - it will have the opposite
effect of making it ***impossible*** to rebuild an existing failed drive - you have been warned!
:end

:newperms_1_plug:
This is a mandatory one-time action to be taken after upgrading from a pre-5.0 Unraid server release to Unraid v5 or a later release.
Select **ALL DISKS** when performing this one-time action.

This utility is also useful for restoring default ownership/permissions on files and
directories when transitioning back from Active Directory to non-Active Directory integration.

The utility starts a background process that goes to each of your data disks and cache disks and selected user shares
and changes file and directory ownership to *nobody/users* (i.e., uid/gid to 99/100), and sets permissions
as follows:
:end

:newperms_2_plug:
For directories:
  drwxrwxrwx

For read/write files:
  -rw-rw-rw-

For readonly files:
  -r--r--r--
:end

:newperms_3_plug:
Clicking **Start** will open another window and start the background process.

Closing the window before completion will terminate the background process - so don't do that. This process can take a long time if you have many files.

Note that this tool may negatively affect any docker containers if you allow your appdata share to be included.
:end

:registration_1_plug:
Your server will not be usable until you purchase a Registration key or install a free 30-day *Trial* key. A *Trial*
key provides all the functionality of a *Pro* Registration key.

Registration keys are bound to your USB Flash boot device serial number (GUID).  Please use a high quality name brand device
at least 1GB in size.

Note: USB memory card readers are generally **not** supported because most do not present unique serial numbers.
:end

:registration_2_plug:
+ Please make sure your [server time](DateTime) is accurate to within 5 minutes.
+ Please make sure there is a [DNS server](NetworkSettings) specified.
:end

:registration_3_plug:
Your *Trial* key includes all the functionality and device support of a *Pro* Registration key.

After your *Trial* key has reached expiration, your server **still functions normally** until the next time you **Stop** the array.

At that point, you may either purchase a Registration key, or request a *Trial* extension.
:end

:registration_4_plug:
To continue using Unraid OS you may purchase a Registration key. Alternately, you may request a *Trial* extension key.

Most *Trial* extension requests are processed immediately but please allow up to one business day to receive your *Trial* extension key.
:end

:registration_5_plug:
It is not possible to use a *Trial* key with an existing Unraid OS installation.

You may purchase a Registration key corresponding to this USB Flash device to continue using this installation.

For more information, please [Contact Support](https://lime-technology.com/contact).
:end

:registration_6_plug:
It appears that your Registration key file is corrupted or missing.  The key file should be located in the
[config](/Registration/Browse?dir&#61;/boot/config) directory on your USB Flash boot device.

If you do not have a backup copy of your Registration key file, [Contact Support](https://lime-technology.com/contact).

If this was a *Trial* installation, you may purchase a Registration key.
:end

:registration_7_plug:
*Trial* installations are only valid with the originally registered USB Flash device.

To continue using this installation with this USB Flash device, you may purchase a Registration key.
:end

:registration_8_plug:
The Registration key file does not correspond to the USB Flash boot device.
Please copy the correct key file to the [config](/Registration/Browse?dir&#61;/boot/config) directory
on your USB Flash boot device. If you do not have a backup copy of your key file, [Contact Support](https://lime-technology.com/contact).

If you want to replace your Registration key with a new key bound to this USB Flash device, click Replace Key below. An original key may be
replaced anytime. Thereafter, a replacement key may be replaced again after one year has passed.  If you require
another replacement key sooner, [Contact Support](https://lime-technology.com/contact).

**Note:** Replacing a Registration key results in permanently *blacklisting* the previous USB Flash GUID.
:end

:registration_9_plug:
This USB Flash boot device has been *blacklisted*. This can occur as a result of transfering your Registration key to
a replacement USB Flash device, and you are currently booted from your old USB Flash device.

A USB Flash device may also be *blacklisted* if there is no serial number, or if we discover the serial number
is not unique (this is common with USB card readers).

For more information, please [Contact Support](https://lime-technology.com/contact).
