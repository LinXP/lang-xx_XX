> Hover your mouse over an any active area on the UD page and a tool tip will show you what clicking that area does.
> You can mount USB devices, sata drives, Remote SMB/NFS shares, and ISO Files with UD.  Any devices with the auto mount switch on will be mounted when the array is started.  All drives and SMB/NFS Mounts are unmounted when the array is stopped on the 'stopping_svcs' event.
> If you want to share your drive, you can turn on the Share switch.  The default for Remote SMB shares is Public read/write access.  Enable SMB Security by user in the Unassigned Devices Settings.  NFS shares are exported and access is read/write.  The export of NFS devices is enabled in the Unassigned Devices settings. You can also enable a common script that will be executed on every disk mount.  In order to share any UD device, sharing needs to be enabled in the UD Settings and the switch turned on to share the particular device.  SMB/NFS remove shares and ISO mounts are always shared.

> + Any disk formatted in UD that is encrypted will use the array password/passphrase and can be incorporated into the array.  Or you can set a unique password when it is formatted.  If you set a password on the disk when it is formatted, you will need to enter a disk password in Unassignd Devices->Settings for that disk.
