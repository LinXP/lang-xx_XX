The Tips below are suggestions, workarounds for known problems, and potential fixes=str3|tipsandtweaks
It is recommended that you update Unraid to the latest stable version to get the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates=str4|tipsandtweaks
Support for older versions of Unraid is being phased out=str5|tipsandtweaks
Many plugins are no longer compatible with older Unraid versons=str6|tipsandtweaks
Install the Fix Common Problems plugin and resolve any Unraid configuration problems=str7|tipsandtweaks
Use the Update Assistant that is part of the Fix Common Problems plugin=str8|tipsandtweaks
This will identify potential problems to be solved before you upgrade the Unraid OS=str9|tipsandtweaks
Check the=str10|tipsandtweaks
Tips and Tweaks wiki=str11|tipsandtweaks
for additional ideas on improving your Unraid performance and solving problems=str12|tipsandtweaks
Some have reported better VM performance with media streaming and gaming VMs with the suggestions on this=str13|tipsandtweaks
post=str14|tipsandtweaks
Some have reported faster and more consistent network performance by making changes in networking parameters on the Tweaks tab of this plugin=str15|tipsandtweaks
If you have an Intel Processor, it may appear that all CPUs are constantly running at full speed=str16|tipsandtweaks
Read this=str17|tipsandtweaks
for information on the issue=str18|tipsandtweaks
If you set the 'Power Save' CPU Governor, you may see your processors stuck at 800 MHz=str19|tipsandtweaks
It is recommended you use the 'Performance' Governor for best performance and power savings=str20|tipsandtweaks
It is recommended to use the pstate driver on Intel processors if you want the most performance=str21|tipsandtweaks
Note=str22|tipsandtweaks
You can check CPU frequencies on the command line with=str23|tipsandtweaks
The dashboard shows CPU loading and not CPU frequency=str24|tipsandtweaks
If you configure VLANs on Unraid, you should make Unraid the Master Browser=str25|tipsandtweaks
If you dont Unraid may not detect the Master Browser for all network interfaces correctly=str26|tipsandtweaks
Some people are reporting OOM out of memory errors=str27|tipsandtweaks
This seems to be occurring more now because of the large amounts of memory being installed in Unraid and the default Disk Cache settings too high=str28|tipsandtweaks
If you are experiencing OOM errors, try adjusting the Disk Cache settings on the Tweaks page=str29|tipsandtweaks
There is a very cool feature in Unraid 6 and up that can be used to capture your logs and help in troubleshooting a situation where your server locks up or becomes unresponsive=str30|tipsandtweaks
Go to Settings->Syslog Server and enable the Syslog Server=str31|tipsandtweaks
Put the IP address of your server in the Remote syslog server field=str32|tipsandtweaks
This will log all your server log enries to the Syslog Server and save the log to an array share=str33|tipsandtweaks
After a reboot from a lockup or hung server, you can view the saved log using the Syslog viewer=str34|tipsandtweaks
The first thing you should do is to install the Fix Common Problems plugin to find and fix common problems=str35|tipsandtweaks
Correct any problems that are identified before doing any tweaking=str36|tipsandtweaks
You may actually cause more problems than you solve if there are problems with your Unraid configuration=str37|tipsandtweaks
Make one change at a time and verify if it improves your situation=str38|tipsandtweaks
Make changes slowly=str39|tipsandtweaks
Making changes here can briefly interrupt your network operation=str40|tipsandtweaks
Some of the settings will consume RAM and may end up causing Linux to terminate some processes to free up RAM=str41|tipsandtweaks

:tips_tweaks_general_plug:
> Some General Recommendations:
>
> + Use of a static IP address can help in certain cases.  NFS shares are referenced by IP address.  Be sure you reserve the IP address on your router, or set a very high IP address to prevent conflicts.
> + Use of Jumbo Frames is discouraged.  Jumbo Frames have been known to cause issues with some Dockers.
> + Don't set vm.dirty.ratio above 20% unless you have a UPS backup for your Unraid.  You may lose data that has not been written to disk on a power failure.
> + A value of vm.dirty_background_ratio over 1/2 of vm.dirty_ratio is not recommended unless using single digits for both values.

:tips_tweaks_nic_flow_control_plug:
> Set to 'Yes' to disable NIC Flow Control.  NIC Flow Control was originally implemented to help in
> networks with mixed speed devices.  It doesn't seem to be as necessary on today's networks.  If you
> have a managed switch, flow control can generally be turned on and off on the switch.  If you have
> a consumer grade switch, you won't have that level of control.  Flow Control has been known to create
> network issues in certain circumstances.  It is recommended to disable Flow Control if you experience network issues.
>
> Changing from any setting to 'Default' requires a reboot.
:end

:tips_tweaks_nic_offload_plug:
> Set to 'Yes' to disable NIC offloads.  Offloads were developed to offload some network processing
> to the NIC and off the main CPU and deal with large packets.  This was intended to save some CPU processing
> load and increase network throughput.  TSO offload has been known to cause network issues in certain circumstances.
> It is recommended to disable NIC Offloads if you experience network issues.
>
> Changing from any setting to 'Default' requires a reboot.

:tips_tweaks_rx_buffer_plug:

:tips_tweaks_dirty_background_plug:
> For streaming and gaming VMs, set the values low in the single digits.  Recommended values are: vm.dirty_background_ratio=str120|tipsandtweaks
> If you have large amounts of RAM, smaller is better.
> Caution: Don't increase these values beyond the default settings unless you have a UPS that will reliably shut down Unraid.
>
> Set the 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' as a percentage of total RAM memory.
> The default setting of 10% is recommended in most cases.  If you have a media streaming or gaming VM, use a value of 2%.  If you experience OOM errors, it is recommended you set this to 1%.
:end

:tips_tweaks_dirty_ratio_plug:
> Set the 'vm.dirty_ratio' as a percentage of total RAM memory.
> Setting this too high may cause Linux to terminate some processes to gain more memory.  The default setting of 20% is recommended in most cases.  If you have a media streaming or gaming VM, use a value of 3%.  If you experience OOM errors, it is recommended you set this to 2%.

:tips_tweaks_cpu_governor_plug:
> Select the CPU Scaling Governor you want to use.
>
> + "Power Save" - Default for the Intel Pstate driver.  Scales CPU frequency based on load.
> + "On Demand" - Default for ACPI CPU Freq driver.  Scales CPU frequency based on load.  Frequency stepping is aggressive.
> + "Conservative" - Scales CPU frequency based on load.  Frequency stepping is gentler.  Can cause some latency.
> + "Performance" - Set all CPUs at full frequency regardless of load.  This can have a positive influence on performance and latency.
> + "Schedutil" - Set all CPUs frequency scaling to schedutil.  This sets CPU frequency based on the Linux scheduler.  Note: This is still in development.
> + "Scheduled" - At start time set governor to "Performance".  At stop time set governor to "Powersave" or "On Demand" depending on driver used.
>
> You can now set the CPU governor with the rc.tweaks script.  Use the command:
> /usr/local/sbin/rc.tweaks set_governor 'governor'
> The 'governor' choices are: 'ondemand', 'performance', 'powersave', 'conservative', and 'schedutil'.
